tracker_type: bytetrack
track_high_thresh: 0.2      # Lower than default (0.25) - fewer missed detections
track_low_thresh: 0.05      # Lower than default (0.1) - recover weak detections  
new_track_thresh: 0.3       # Higher than default (0.25) - reduce false new tracks
track_buffer: 60            # 2x default (30) - keep lost tracks 2 seconds @ 30fps
match_thresh: 0.85          # Slightly higher (0.8) - more forgiving IoU match
fuse_score: True            # Fuse detection score with motion/IoU for matching
